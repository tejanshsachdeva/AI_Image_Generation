# AI_Image_Generation

This is a website in which you can generate images using text promts. It uses OpenAI API DALL-E and generates in maximum possible resolution i.e 1024 x 1024.

The commpunity sharing system is currently under work in which you will be able to dounload the required image.
Additional functionality such as using customised API Key will be implemented later. 

The tech-stack used is MERN and the backend is hosted on render whereas front-end on netlify using custom build. 
The images are simulatneously uploaded on Cloudinary so as to optimize the process and consuiming less net backend space. 
Feel free to fork the project and expreiment with it. 
Help is taken from You-Tube and Documentations.

I won't be able to share the link for the same because it is hosted on my API _KEY and having limited credits and max capacity of generation 250 images.
